                    In the course of using technology, bugs happen. Sometimes software
                    does the wrong thing, or doesn't anticipate what you want to do with
                    it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this new era of open-source software, it's easy to tell
                    software authors that something's wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's what you need to put in your bug report so
                    coders have all of the information they need to help you.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2 class='center'>What's Wrong?</h2>
            <blockquote class='pad2'>It's broken&hellip;</blockquote>
            <div class='pad2'>
                <p>
                    If you're reporting a bug, that generally means that something
                    is broken, or wrong about software.
                </p>
                <p class='guide pad2 center'>
                    what did you expect to happen? &rarr; what happened instead?
                </p>
                <p>
                    So be sure to say not only that something is broken, but
                    how exactly it's broken: does the software give an incorrect
                    result, or no result at all? If the result is incorrect,
                    what did it give, and what did you expect it to give if it
                    worked correctly?
                </p>

                    I added 2 + 2 in my calculator.<br />
                    I expected it to give me a result of 4.<br />
                    Instead, it gives 5.

                    Sometimes software works in one place, for one person,
                    but doesn't somewhere else. Your operating system,
                    browser, and other installed software all has some
                    impact on the bugs that crop up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Include some basic information about your setup to make
                    issues easier to debug. If it's a web-based application
                    that you use in a browser, include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Browser &amp; Version
                    <li>Browser extensions, if any
                    <li>Operating System
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For installed software and libraries, there are some other
                    things to report:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Operating System
                    <li>How you installed the software: as a download, from
                    a package manager, or from source
                    <li>Interpreter version, if it's software in a scripting language -
                    are you using Python 2 or 3, or node.js v0.4.0 or v0.6.0?
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2 class='center'>Be Nice</h2>
            <blockquote class='pad2'>This is broken - I spent hours debugging it!</blockquote>
            <div class='pad2'>
                <p>
                    Maybe the bug ate your homework, or it's taken you hours
                    to track down the culprit and the bug is something
                    really silly, something that <em>nobody</em> would ever do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's okay to be personally annoyed, but be polite on the internet:
                    nobody deserves abuse.
