                    In the course of using technology, bugs happen. Sometimes software
                    does the wrong thing, or doesn't anticipate what you want to do with
                    it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this new era of open-source software, it's easy to tell
                    the people that made that software that something's wrong.
                </p>

                    So that those wise folks can help you and fix the problem,
                    it's important to give the right details in the right way.
                    Here are a few hints.

                    Maybe the bug ate your homework, or it's taken you hours
                    to track down the culprit and the bug is something
                    really silly, something that <em>nobody</em> would ever do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's okay to be annoyed, but it's not useful or productive
                    to talk about this too much - just like adding 'ASAP' to
                    every email, software developers are used to folks trying
                    to set their priorities. And, like everyone else, they have
                    a lot of priorities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, take advantage of the fact that programmers love
                    easy problems. And if you can give enough detail
                    for them to debug your issue quickly, it'll get fixed quickly.

                    Before reporting your bug, <a href='http://debugbrowser.com/'>open your web browser's debug tools</a>,
                    look in the 'error console', and, if there's anything there,
                    copy and paste it, in full, and add it to your bug report.
